/*
38.	Create a class Employee with three data members (empNo, salary and totalSalary) and following features.
a.	Only parameterized constructor. [Do not overload the constructor]
b.	totalSalary always represents salary total of all the employees created.
c.	empNo should be auto incremented.
d.	display total employees and totalSalary using a method.
Create another class EmployeeDemo (main class) that creates some Employee objects and calls Employee method to display no. of employees and total of their salaries.
